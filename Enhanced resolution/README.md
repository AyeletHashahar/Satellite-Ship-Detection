# Satellite Ship Image Super-Resolution using SwinIR 🚢🛰️✨

This project applies **SwinIR (Swin Transformer for Image Restoration)** to enhance the resolution of satellite images, specifically focusing on **ship detection and visualization**. It leverages pre-trained SwinIR models to upscale images and improve visual clarity and detail—essential for analyzing low-resolution satellite captures.

## 🔍 What is SwinIR?
SwinIR is a state-of-the-art image restoration model based on the Swin Transformer. It excels at tasks like:
- Super-resolution
- Denoising
- Compression artifact reduction
